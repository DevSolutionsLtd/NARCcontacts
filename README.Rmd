# NARCcontacts

An R package to make managing data a little easier for 'Nehemians'.

## Installation

You can install NARCcontacts from GitHub with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("DevSolutionsLtd/NARCcontacts")
```

## Instructions for use

To harmonise the data, move all the Excel files that contain contact details into a directory (folder). For instance if the folder is called *Contacts*, then do this in the R console

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(NARCcontacts)
harmonise_narc_excel("path/to/Contacts")
```

## Disclaimer

The package is developed for a particular client, but with some tweaking can be extended for more generic use.
